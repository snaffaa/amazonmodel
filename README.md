# Public repository of the Amazon production and Transport Model

Compiled_model.sh explains the full process of running the model. The output of the Amazon sediment production model is used as an input of the Amazon sediment transport model. 
The running of  the model depends on basic support functions for reading and converting input. We have started on automating this preparatory work too and there is an outline of the process in the form of the abovementioned shell script. This script is still very much work in progress . Therefore, running the model currently requires some manual work to setup. 

# Installation:

You need to follow the steps for PCRGLOB-WB installation her https://github.com/UU-Hydro/PCR-GLOBWB_model. 
We recommend to install Miniconda, particularly for Python 2.7 instead of Python 3. The model used python 2.7.6
